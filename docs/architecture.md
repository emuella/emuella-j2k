# Architecture

The workspace separates public policy from codec mechanisms:

```text
emuella-j2k
  └── emuella-j2k-core
        ├── emuella-j2k-container
        └── emuella-j2k-codestream
              ├── emuella-j2k-tier1
              ├── emuella-j2k-ht
              └── emuella-j2k-transform
                    └── emuella-j2k-accel
```

`emuella-j2k` is the stable public facade and re-exports the application API
implemented by `emuella-j2k-core`. The core crate owns caller-visible images,
parameters, errors, support classification, and high-level
inspect/decode/encode entry points. Lower-level crates parse boxes and markers,
walk packets, decode or encode code blocks, and apply transforms. Optional
parallel and SIMD paths retain deterministic scalar fallbacks.

Classic block coding in `emuella-j2k-tier1` uses a project-authored Annex C MQ
coder and Annex D coefficient-context model. Its standards basis, design
boundary, and qualification record are documented in
[`tier1-implementation.md`](tier1-implementation.md).

The CLI and Python crates are adapters; they must not become alternate codec
implementations. The test-support crate creates deterministic inputs through
project-owned algorithms. External reference codecs and corpora are never
runtime dependencies.
