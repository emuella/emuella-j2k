# Testing and corpus boundary

Ordinary tests are Layer 1: small, deterministic, project-authored inputs
created in memory. They require no network, external executable, or adjacent
repository. `emuella-j2k-test-support` contains the shared generator and
round-trip tests.

Optional conformance and interoperability work is Layer 2. The first inspection
smoke runner consumes the pinned `layer2/conformance-jpeg-2000` suite and its
locally materialised `jpeg-2000/conformance` pack:

```sh
cargo build -p emuella-j2k-cli
python3 scripts/run-layer2-conformance-inspection.py \
  --testdata /path/to/emuella-testdata
```

The explicit command is the opt-in boundary. It does not acquire data or
accept terms. Before invoking the codec, it requires the locked catalogue
commit and a clean tracked checkout, checks the suite revision and pack
version, verifies every inventory file and the authoritative archive digest,
and recomputes the complete materialised-tree digest. It then selects every
`.j2k`, `.htj2k`, `.jp2`, and `.jph` inventory candidate, requires exactly one
catalogue-owned format/cohort classification, and inspects each file in its own
process with a per-file timeout. Integrity failures, empty or unclassified
selections, crashes, timeouts, unexpected acceptance or rejection, and
rejection-diagnostic mismatches make the run fail.

The normal invocation binds its evidence to this codec checkout. Run the
documented `cargo build` immediately beforehand; the runner then requires a
clean tracked checkout, reports its full `HEAD`, verifies that the executable
is this worktree's canonical `target/debug/emuella-j2k`, and copies it to one
private execution snapshot. Every candidate runs through that snapshot; its
SHA-256 is reported and rechecked after inspection, alongside the canonical
source path and checkout. This identifies the tested checkout and bytes but is
not a cryptographic build-provenance attestation.

An arbitrary executable may be exercised explicitly with
`--unbound-codec --codec /path/to/executable`. That mode still records the
executable digest, but labels its source revision unbound and produces
diagnostic evidence rather than pinned qualification evidence. It is intended
for project-authored orchestration tests and deliberate external comparisons,
not release qualification.

The deterministic summary separates J2K, HTJ2K, JP2, and JPH results by their
Annex C, Annex G, or informative Annex H cohort. Successful metadata inspection
does not mean native decoding is supported; those are distinct API outcomes.
Ordinary `cargo test` runs only project-authored runner and parser cases and
never invokes this live corpus journey.

Pinned qualification in CI is Layer 3. It should record the codec revision,
catalogue revision, pack ID and version, and pack digest. Restricted packs must
be pre-provisioned. Missing restricted data is never fetched as a side effect
of `cargo test`.

No Kakadu SDK, external codec binary or source, OpenJPEG/OpenJPH output,
standards insert, PDF, OCR transcript, or externally sourced fixture is
permitted in this repository. Another implementation may be executed as an
authorised black-box interoperability oracle, but only project-authored
summaries of observed behaviour may enter public project artefacts; its source,
binaries, fixtures, output payloads, verbatim diagnostics, generated files, and
other artefacts remain outside them. The only source-derived codec
exception is the closed set of OpenJPH-derived files and pinned inputs already
enumerated in `THIRD_PARTY.md`; changing that set requires prior maintainer
approval through an explicit human copyright, licence, provenance, and
architectural review.

Library support classification is structural and algorithmic. Exact-payload
classifiers, embedded reference-pixel replay, empty fixture-array placeholders,
and compatibility APIs named after an external codec do not belong in the
runtime crates. Corpus-specific expectations stay in `emuella-testdata` and its
harnesses.

### Decoded-pixel canary

The first decoded-pixel Layer 2 journey consumes the catalogue-owned
`decoded_pixel_comparison` case for `p0_01.j2k` and its single PGX component
reference:

```sh
cargo build -p emuella-j2k-cli
python3 scripts/run-layer2-decoded-pixel-canary.py \
  --testdata /path/to/emuella-testdata
```

The outer runner applies the same pinned checkout, inventory, complete-tree,
and executable-snapshot checks as the inspection runner. It invokes one Rust
worker with a finite timeout. The worker decodes the selected component, parses
the PGX reference with project-authored code, and compares logical samples in
memory. Its output is restricted to dimensions, sample count, peak absolute
error, mean squared error, limits, and pass/fail state; input, reference, and
decoded pixel payloads are neither persisted nor printed.

ISO/IEC 15444-4:2024, published conformance-testing authority, Annex B, B.2,
PDF pages 23–27, defines the logical-output preparation and the inclusive peak
and mean-squared-error comparison. Annex C, C.2.1.1–C.2.1.3 and Table C.1, PDF
page 31, identify this Class-0/Profile-0 mapping and assign zero to both limits.
The reviewed transcription used for the contract was retrieval revision
`725ecba70e5d03eff3f6ce9626bb9cb08dd4e0c7` (reviewed bundle
`7b3d8d60cd4d4f6c056cd108d928b7f99f492aa9`). Exactness therefore applies to
corresponding logical samples for this case, not to file bytes.

## Reserved parameterless marker basis

The project-authored parser regression for `0xFF30`–`0xFF3F` records the rule
behind the `p0_02.j2k` repair without copying conformance bytes. ISO/IEC
15444-1:2024, published normative core, Annex A, A.1.2 and A.1.3, PDF pages
32–33, classifies that range as parameterless markers and requires decoders to
skip them. The canonical transcription used for the change was retrieval
revision `34e5d1639b9f121807e620c001893ca9d2c8f977` (reviewed bundle
`1a7a03799078b476bf38e91786b979059b4c533d`).

ISO/IEC 15444-4:2024, published conformance-testing authority, Annex C,
C.2.1.1 and Table C.1, PDF page 31, identifies `p0_02.j2k` as a positive
Profile-0 decoder test with a reference result. Informative C.2.1.4 and Table
C.2, PDF page 32, identify the reserved marker among the syntax it exercises.
That transcription was retrieval revision
`725ecba70e5d03eff3f6ce9626bb9cb08dd4e0c7` (reviewed bundle
`7b3d8d60cd4d4f6c056cd108d928b7f99f492aa9`). The smoke result proves only
that metadata inspection accepts this valid syntax; it does not prove decoded
pixels or every other feature in that conformance input.
